# SsdtParser
A SQL script parser for SSDT

## Goal
The purpose of this project is to be able to parse database schemas from scripts in an SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) project.
The ultimate goal is to use the parsed tables, columns and relationships in conjunction with an F# database type provider.
This would eliminate the need for a live database connection when used in conjunction with SSDT.
